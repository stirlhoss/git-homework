# Thoughts on first classes
+ I have already learned a lot about organisation and making sure that you are keeping track of your time.
+ Working with calendars is harder than working with terminal.

# New strategies to implement
+ Actually stick to the calendar
+ Transfer all notes from handwritten to digital

# Shoutout
+ I had an interesting back and forth with Sarah Melton that forced me to look up some documentation that was new to me.

# Session 3 breakout room
+ When cream goes sour, we throw it away. Then we go to the store and buy sour cream?
