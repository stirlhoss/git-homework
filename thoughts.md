# Thoughts on first classes
+ I have already learned a lot about organisation and making sure that you are keeping track of your time.
+ Working with calendars is harder than working with terminal.

# New strategies to implement
+ Actually stick to the calendar
+ Transfer all notes from handwritten to digital

# Shoutout
+ I had an interesting back and forth with Sarah Melton that forced me to look up some documentation that was new to me.
